# FPSPlayground

First Person Controller demo project featuring a player state machine: Walking, running, sliding, jumping, wall sliding, wall jumping

All of the characteristics are tunable on a per-state basis, allowing custom acceleration, top-speed, friction, and input weights exclusively through exports.

Also features some 'juice' in the form of head-bob, head tilt, and FOV scaling - also adjusted via values per-state.
